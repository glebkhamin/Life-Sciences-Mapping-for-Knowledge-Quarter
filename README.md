# Life Sciences Mapping for Knowledge Quarter

The Knowledge Quarter (KQ) is a consortium of 100+ academic, cultural, research, scientific and media organisations occupying a one-mile radius around the British Library, including King's Cross, Bloomsbury and Euston. The KQ team knits these organisations together to promote knowledge exchange through a broad range of stakeholder engagement and member activity. Collectively, the geographic area of the Knowledge Quarter is the UK’s largest innovation district.

In 2018, The KQ conducted an audit that highlighted the KQ area as a leading area for life sciences. With institutions such as the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, University College London and the Francis Crick Institute, the KQ area is highly concentrated with life sciences expertise, making it a prime location to establish a life sciences company. The purpose of this report is to refresh the understanding of the life sciences ecosystem in the KQ area and increase their awareness of knowledge clusters internationally. Four finalists at UCL BASc Arts and Sciences created this report surveying the current UK life sciences domain within the parameters of the KQ as well as knowledge clusters globally. As a deliverable, a database was created, mapping all the relevant life sciences organisations within the KQ area so that the KQ team can begin developing a flourishing life sciences ecosystem.

The UK life sciences field is evidently a major contributor to the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the high quality of innovation and research that occurs in industry and academia. This report focuses on the key role London plays, financing and capital-raising, talent, data and the NHS, all within the context of the life sciences. This report also discusses UK, EU and US clusters, highlighting the contrasts in each regions’ visions. Lastly, the report details the methodology of creating a database mapping the life sciences ecosystem in the KQ region as well as provides an overview of what is currently present in the area.

Summary of Recommendations

(1) The KQ should focus on networking opportunities and community building to develop a flourishing life-sciences ecosystem that will facilitate knowledge transfer between industry and academia.

(2) Educational partnerships within the KQ can aid in achieving the UK Government’s Vision by bridging the data science gap, amongst other benefits.

(3) KQ can act as a data hub, allowing knowledge transfer between academia, industry and healthcare to facilitate development.

(4) KQ can focus on developing an environment to grow life sciences businesses, rather than establish them.

(5) Collaborations beyond the KQ region can be developed to build a knowledge network.

(6) The collaborations within and beyond the KQ region can digitalised to facilitate awareness
and potential data sharing.
